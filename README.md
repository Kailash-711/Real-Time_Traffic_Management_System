## Real-Time Traffic Management System

### Objective
To control traffic lights efficiently based on traffic congestion. 

### How this Model works 
   Time sharing based but efficiency is achieved by adopting following 
   techniques
   - green light will be "on" only when vehicles presence on the lane.
   - add more time to lanes when high congession occurs
   - periodical processing of traffic lanes
             

# Working Model
 - Application written in Python and runs in windows environment
 - Vehicle present in lanes is detected by sensors and web cams
 - Sensors if used to detect traffic, must be connected to Arduino board and Arduino board
   connected to application windows machine via serial port. Application
   will communicate with application running in Arduino to read sensor
   data. Application will determine presence of traffic by received values
   of Sensor data.
 - Web cams are directly  connected to windows machine and images of
   vehicle movements on lanes are detected and processed by
   Python/OpenCV
 - Virtual Traffic Lights or if LEDs are used as traffic lights they must be connected to Arduino board
   and application communicates with Arduino to on/off LEDs 

# Requirements

   - Windows 10 home
   - Python 3.9.6
   - OpenCV 4.5.2

### To Run Application
- py videom.py sit1.txt  
     System Initialization Table is passed as first parameter 
     - sit1.txt -- demonstrate 4 lane traffic
     - sit2.txt -- demonstrate 3 lane trrafic with pedestrian crossing
     - sit3.txt -- demonstrate 3 lane traffic with pedestrian crossing with virtual traffic lights which use no arduino components and                      use web cams to detect traffic.
- before starting the application if arduino components are used
   - tfrcntl.ino Arduino file under “tfrcntl” folder must be uploaded to
     Arduino board using Arduino GUI
   - All sensors and LEDs must be checked
 - All web cams must be checked

     Other parameters are same as of lane definition table.


# Traffic Light Control Table  

    { "lane":1,  
      "red":[ ["c1", [3,"O",0], [4,"F",1000], [2,"O",0], [3,"F",0] ] ],  
      "green":[ ["c1",[3,"O",0], [2,"F",1000], [4,"O",0], [3,"F",0] ] ]  
    }  
    
    lane - lane id
    red  - When application need to light up for example red light of the lane 1 it will 
           send Arduino board Id "c1" following message  
           1)  Wait for zero milliseconds and "On" LED connected to digital pin "3"  
               For example to on yellow  
           2)  Wait for 1000 milliseconds and "Off" LED connected to digital pin "4"   
               For example to off green  
           3)  Wait for zero milliseconds and "On" LED connected to digital pin "2"   
               For example to on red  
           4)  Wait for zero milliseconds and "Off" LED connected to digital pin "3"  
               For example to off yellow 
               
               There can be another entry as beleow
               [3,"B",0,1000,3000 ] --> To Blink --> Wait 0 millseconds, "On" led connected to pin "3", 
                                        wait 1000 milliseconds, "Off", wait 1000 miliseconds
                                        do this on/off process untill 3000 milliseconds  elapsed  
               This is usefull for pedestrian crossing definitions                         
    green - to light up green, same as red  
    
    { "lane":99,  
      "red":[ ["c1", [2,"O",0], [5,"O",0], [8,"O",0], [11,"O",0] ] ]  
      "vtlid":[  [1, ["R-2","Y-3","G-4"] ], [2, ["R-5","Y-6","G-7"] ], [3, ["R-8","G-10"] ] ]

    }  
    lane '99' is a special lane, which is used by the system to set all red lights of lanes to "On"  
    when system is start up. Here red LEDs of lanes are connected to  digital pins 2, 5, 8 and 11 of Arudino  
    board
    'vtlid' is optional and required if virtual traffic light system is used
    [ 1,["R-2","Y-3","G-4"] ]  - lane 1 has three lights with id 2, 3 and 4. Light 2 is Red, Light 3 is Yellow and light 4 is Green.
    
    
# Test System
After system is setup all the sensors, LEDs and web cams must be checked  

# py chksensor.py COM3 A0  
To check a sensor connected to analog pin ( for ex. A0 ) of Arduino board connected to a   
serial port ( for ex. COM3 ) of windows  Here desirable values for "srtm", "rtime" and "rdelay" can be found ( by modifying chksensor.py program )  

# py chkled.py COM3 2
To check LED connected to digital pin ( for ex. 2 ) 

# py chkcam.py 0 chkcam.txt
To check Cam connected to windows machine ( for ex. cam 0 ) and cam info given in the chkcam.txt file.
Here number assign to a cam by windows and desirable values for "detectarea", "mincarea" and maxcarea parms 
of the lane entry of lane definition table is specified in chkcam.txt file.  

# Conclusion
- This system is s single threaded and useful to control traffic in
moderately congested traffic.
- To achieve high efficiency and redundancy to handle high traffic lanes
we may have to deploy more than one sensors/cams to monitor lanes.
Such system will be multi threaded and we may have to deploy machine
learning techniques to determine time for lanes by considering traffic on
the lanes without allocating max times as in this model to achieve high
efficiency.
